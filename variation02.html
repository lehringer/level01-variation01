<h1>I Felt a Funeral in My Brain</h1>
<h3>By Emily Dickenson</h3>

</br>
  <body>
		<p>I &nbsp; felt &nbsp; a &nbsp; Funeral, &nbsp; in &nbsp; my &nbsp; Brain,</br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  And &nbsp; Mourners &nbsp; to &nbsp; &nbsp; and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fro</br> 
           &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Kept treading - treading - till it seemed</br> 
           &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That &nbsp; Sense &nbsp; &nbsp; was &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; breaking &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; through -</br> 
           </p>   

		<p>And &nbsp; when &nbsp; they &nbsp; all &nbsp; were &nbsp; seated,</br> 
           A &nbsp; Service, &nbsp; like &nbsp; a &nbsp; Drum - </br> 
           Kept &nbsp; beating &nbsp; - &nbsp; beating &nbsp;  - &nbsp; till &nbsp; I &nbsp; thought<br> 
           My &nbsp; mind &nbsp; was &nbsp; going &nbsp; numb -</br> 
          </p>

		<p>And then I heard them &nbsp; lift &nbsp; &nbsp; a &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Box</br> 
           And &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; creak &nbsp; &nbsp; across &nbsp; my Soul</br> 
		   With &nbsp; those &nbsp; same &nbsp; Boots &nbsp; of &nbsp; Lead, &nbsp; again,</br> 
           Then &nbsp; Space &nbsp; - &nbsp; began &nbsp; to &nbsp; toll,</br> 
		   </p>  
		<p>As &nbsp; all  &nbsp; the &nbsp; Heavens &nbsp; were &nbsp; a &nbsp; Bell,</br> 
            And &nbsp; Being,&nbsp;  but &nbsp; an &nbsp; Ear,</br> 
            And &nbsp; I, &nbsp; and &nbsp; Silence, &nbsp; some &nbsp; strange &nbsp; Race,</br> 
            Wrecked, &nbsp; solitary,&nbsp;  here -</br> 
            </p>

		<p>And &nbsp; then &nbsp; a &nbsp; &nbsp; Plank &nbsp; &nbsp; in Reason, broke,</br> 
           And &nbsp; I &nbsp; &nbsp; dropped &nbsp; &nbsp; down, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; down -</br>
           And &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; hit &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; World, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; at &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; every &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; plunge,</br> 
           And &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Finished &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; knowing &nbsp; - &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; then -</br>
